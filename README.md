# Hollow Knight Mod Installer

### Steps to set up the mod installer:

1. Verify/repair the game through Steam/whatever to make sure there isn't any modified file
2. Start the mod installer and select your current Assembly-CSharp.dll
3. Load mod bundles and have fun (hopefully)

Most of the time you don't need to run the installer with administrative privilegues. (Just normally double-click the .jar file)

### Download
[See releases section](https://github.com/timoschwarzer/hollow-knight-mod-installer/releases)

### How are mod bundles built?

They are just zip archives. Take a look inside, the most things and the basic structure is self-explanatory.
